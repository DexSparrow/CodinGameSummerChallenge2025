Control territory and attacking ennemy



[Control territory]:
    - Explore (left or right) (Squad context)
        -> try to fill territory
        -> go to territory not owned (rect filling)
        
        -> if my_domain detect ennemy_domain:
            [ATTACK]
    Loop [Control territory]

    # Target assignation (Formation)(Just rank the agents)

[ATTACK]:    
    # can_attack

    if not can_attack:
        expand while avoid ennemy
        -> break
    
    - Try to find spot and attack
        (dir should be guessed using side-detection if agent.x < ennemy.x : ennemy on my left)
        -> if not spot:
            if agent_ennemy_count > 1:
                - MOVE avoid ennemy(go to most free area)
            else:
                - MOVE (approach)
                [attack]
        -> else:
            find spot and [attack]

[attack]
    # can_attack
    # weapoon [shoot, throw] : sort depending on situation
    # the agent have a target
    - choose weapon:
        -> if target.neighbour >= 1 or agent.isreloading:
            bomb
        -> else:
            shoot
        

Each agent should have an domain (optimal_range):
    - method Agent.getDomain() -> Rect
